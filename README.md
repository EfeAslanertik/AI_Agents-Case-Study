# Agent Based ML Systems: Data Validation and Audit Trail Agents

## Project Overview
This project implements a system of autonomous agents designed to **validate datasets and log agent operations** in a structured, transparent workflow. The goal is to demonstrate agent autonomy, decision-making, and reasoning in a reproducible manner.

The project implements two core agents:

1. **Data Quality Validation Agent** – Inspects input datasets for missing values, anomalies, and type inconsistencies. Produces structured validation reports and flags critical issues.  
2. **Audit Trail Agent** – Captures every agent’s actions, inputs, outputs, and reasoning in a structured log for transparency and traceability.

Together, these agents provide **robust dataset validation** while maintaining a **clear audit trail** of all operations.

**Important**: All test scripts must be run using python -m from the project root to ensure proper module resolution.
